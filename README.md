## TypeScript
TypeScript is a JavaScript with syntax for types.

## Why TypeScript?
Detect error without running the code. **Static Typed Checking**

## How TypeScript work?
TypeScript compiler compile TS code into JS code. this process called **Transpilation**

## TypeScript is a Dynamic or Static?
Let's compare **Dynamic Language** and **Static Language** at first and then give the answer.
1. **Dynamic Language** : 
    - Variables types are dynamic, we can always change it.
    - Type checking at execution time.
    - Error can be detected at execution time
2. **Static Language** :
    - Variables types are static, once we declare it we can't change.
    - Type of variables are known at compile time.
    - Have better performane at run time due to not needing to check types dynamically.
    
So TypeScript is a Static Language.
